"""rerank — pure logic, with the cross-encoder stubbed out.

The real model is ~90MB of weights fetched from HuggingFace and a torch install
the rest of this tree does not need, so every test here injects a scorer instead.
That is not only about speed: what the function actually owns is the ordering
contract around the scores, and a fake scorer is the only way to state a case
like "these two papers tie" and know it holds.

Selection is the other half of what the function owns, and it is not just a
slice: `top_k` counts papers that carry an abstract, and the abstract-less ones
passed on the way to filling it come back in a second list rather than being
dropped. A stubbed scorer is what lets a test state "this paper outranks that
one and has no abstract" and know which list each lands in.

The cases worth the file are the ones the wiring can get wrong. Sorting the
(paper, score) pairs directly rather than by key reads fine and works right up
until two papers tie, where it compares PaperData and raises — so both the tie
and the ordering are pinned. The guards are checked for *not loading the model*
rather than only for their return value, since skipping that download on a blank
query is the whole reason they run first. And the document handed to the model is
asserted field by field: a paper missing an abstract is common enough in OpenAlex
that a stray separator would be the normal case, not the edge one.
