"""remove_duplicates — pure logic, no transport, no fixtures beyond conftest.

The interesting cases are the ones the function exists for: the same paper arriving
from two sources under different DOI casing, the same paper arriving with no DOI or
with two different ones — caught by its title and abstract together, which never match
byte for byte — the preprint that must lose to the version that came out of review, and
the many records missing one of those fields, which must never be judged duplicates on
information they do not carry.
