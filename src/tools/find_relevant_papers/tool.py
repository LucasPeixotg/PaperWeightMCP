    """
    Finds the most relevant papers through multiple sources that could answer a natural language query.

    Args:
        query: The natural language query to search for.
        top_k: The maximum number of top matching paper abstracts to retrieve (default is 5).

    Returns:
        JSON string containing an object with two lists of papers, each paper
        carrying its paper ID, DOI, title, publication year, abstract, direct
        paper URL and license.

        `papers` holds up to top_k matches that come with an abstract — the ones
        worth reading now.

        `relevant_without_abstract` holds matches that ranked among the best but
        whose abstract the source does not publish, so they carry a title and
        little else. That often means the work is not openly available, though
        not always; some publishers restrict the abstract alone. They are still
        worth following by DOI or URL, and their `abstract` field is empty.
