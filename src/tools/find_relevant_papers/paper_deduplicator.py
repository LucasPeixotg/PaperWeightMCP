# Two records of one work are never byte-identical across sources: OpenAlex rebuilds

# The abstract is the discriminating half of the pair — two different papers do not
# share one — so the title is scored the more leniently of the two. Live OpenAlex
# results bear that out: a conference version tagged "(Student Abstract)" scores 93
# against its preprint, an initial-caps variant 94, and nothing in that band matched
# an abstract without being the same work.

    """Collapse papers that are the same work down to the best copy of it.

    The same paper reaches us once per source that indexes it, and ``paper_id``
    cannot spot that — it is an OpenAlex ``W…`` from one client and a Semantic
    Scholar hash from the other. Two identifiers the sources do agree on stand in
    for it, and two papers are the same work when *either* matches:

    * their **DOIs**, when both have one;
    * their **titles and abstracts together**, when both have both — matched by
      similarity rather than equality, since near-identical is as close as two
      sources ever get.

    The pair catches what the DOI alone cannot: preprints, which frequently carry
    no DOI at all, and the preprint-versus-published pair of the same work, which
    carries two different ones.

    Four behaviours worth knowing:

    * **The published copy wins, and it keeps its own position.** A preprint and
      the version that came out of review are one work, and the published record
      carries the better DOI, URL and license, so it survives even when the
      preprint ranked higher. Papers with no evidence either way outrank
      preprints; a tie goes to the first occurrence, which carries the ranking —
      position in the list *is* the ranking, as the OpenAlex client drops
      ``relevance_score`` and relies on payload order.
    * **An absent identifier is never evidence of sameness.** A paper with no DOI
      is not judged by DOI, and one missing a title or an abstract is not judged
      by the pair. Missing information is not proof that two papers match, and
      treating it as such would collapse every abstract-less record into one.
    * **Matching ignores case, punctuation and word order in titles.** DOIs are
      case-insensitive by specification, and the sources genuinely disagree in
      practice: OpenAlex lowercases everything while Semantic Scholar preserves
      the registrant's casing. Titles and abstracts differ the same way, plus the
      stray whitespace that survives extraction.
    * **Matching is transitive.** Papers are grouped by single linkage — a paper
      joins a group when it matches *any* member — because the best copy cannot
      be chosen until the whole group is known.
