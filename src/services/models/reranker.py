def rerank(query: str, papers: list[PaperData], top_k: int) -> RerankedPapers:
    """Reorder papers by how well a cross-encoder thinks each answers the query.

    The papers arrive already ranked, by OpenAlex's bi-encoder: it embeds the
    query and every work's title+abstract *independently* and compares the
    vectors, which is the only thing that scales to millions of works but cannot
    weigh a query term against a particular sentence of a particular abstract.
    A cross-encoder runs the query and one document through the transformer
    *together*, so it can — at a cost that only makes sense on a few dozen
    candidates. Hence the two stages: OpenAlex narrows millions to a pool, this
    reorders the pool.

    Both scored fields can be empty — ``PaperData`` requires all seven fields,
    so both clients coerce an absent value to ``""``, and OpenAlex ships a null
    ``abstract_inverted_index`` often enough to matter. A paper missing one
    field is still scored on the other; a paper missing both scores as the empty
    document, which is the right answer for a record that says nothing. Where
    those papers land is the selection's business, not the scoring's — see
    ``_split_on_abstract``.

    Args:
        query: The natural language query to score relevance against. Pass it
            raw — wildcard cleaning is for search APIs that read ``?`` and ``*``
            as operators, and to a cross-encoder that punctuation is signal.
        papers: The candidates to reorder. Left untouched.
        top_k: How many papers to fill ``papers`` with.

    Returns:
        A ``RerankedPapers`` holding at most ``top_k`` papers that carry an
        abstract, most relevant first, and beside them every abstract-less paper
        that outranked one of them. Papers the model scores equally are broken
        apart by ``relevance_score``, the ranking the source itself gave them;
        papers tied on both keep their input order.

    Example:
        >>> rerank("attention mechanisms", papers, top_k=5)  # doctest: +SKIP
        RerankedPapers(papers=[PaperData(paper_id='W2626778328', ...), ...],
